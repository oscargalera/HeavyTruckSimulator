# HeavyTruckSimulator

This is the Supplementary Material for the paper titled "Heavy-duty truck simulator: a tool to plan charging and charger layouts", a Tool for Planning Charging Strategies and Charger Layouts in Electric Mining Fleets and Optimizing Efficiency with a Simulation Approach by Óscar Galera Martínez.

The code in this repository is derived from the work of Lindgren et al. in their work: Lindgren, L.; Grauers, A.; Ranggård, J.; Mäki, R. Drive-Cycle Simulations of Battery-Electric Large Haul Trucks for Open-Pit Mining with Electric Roads. Energies 2022, 15, 4871. https://doi.org/10.3390/en15134871
This simulation tool was created based on their open-access code, which is available at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/en15134871/s1

**Features:**
* Experiment 1) Planning charger layouts as a function of the mining site and vehicle characteristics, as reported in Section 4.1.1 of the paper
* Experiment 2) Considering the impact of load distribution and spreading out charging times on charger placement, as reported in Section 4.1.2 of the paper
* Experiment 3) Analysing the use of multiple vehicles and how varying the fleet number influences the results, as reported in Section 4.2 of the paper
* Experiment 4) Utilising real-time data to adapt to changing environmental conditions, such as rain, to maintain the mine operations, as reported in Section 4.3 of the paper
